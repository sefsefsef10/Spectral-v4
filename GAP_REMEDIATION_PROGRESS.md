## 🚀 READINESS ASSESSMENT

### Production Readiness by Feature

| Feature | Status | Blocker to Production? |
|---------|--------|----------------------|
| Webhook Security | 75% | YES (critical) |
| Compliance Controls | 83% (50/60) | NO (acceptable) |
| Vendor Certification | 60% | NO (MVP viable) |
| Billing Infrastructure | 20% | YES (for revenue) |
| Advanced Features | 0% | NO (nice-to-have) |

### Go-Live Blockers

**Must Fix Before Production**:
1. ✅ ~Complete Phase 1 webhook security~ (75% done)
2. ⏳ Complete Phase 4 Stripe integration
3. ⏳ Finish Phase 3 certification hardening

**Can Launch Without**:
- Phase 2 additional compliance controls (50/60 is acceptable)
- Phase 5 advanced features (WebSockets, dark mode, etc.)

## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Schema Design**: Adding all tables upfront was efficient - 10 tables in one SQL batch
2. **Security First**: Webhook security infrastructure more complex than expected but critical
3. **Validation Early**: Zod schemas for all webhooks ensures type safety from day 1
4. **Secret Management**: Encryption service integration was seamless

## 📞 EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES

### Services Requiring Configuration (Phase 1)

Once Phase 1 is complete, we'll need to configure webhook signatures in:

1. **LangSmith**: Set webhook secret in project settings
2. **Arize**: Configure signing secret in integration settings
3. **Epic**: Add HMAC secret to webhook subscription
4. **Cerner**: Configure signature verification
5. (And 7 more services...)

**Action Item**: Create developer documentation with setup instructions
