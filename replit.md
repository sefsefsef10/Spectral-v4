## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend utilizes React 18+, TypeScript, Vite, Wouter, Shadcn/ui (Radix UI), and Tailwind CSS, aiming for an executive-grade professional aesthetic and clear data presentation.

### Technical Implementations
The backend is an Express.js application built with TypeScript, featuring a RESTful API. It implements session-based authentication and a zero-trust multi-tenant architecture with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). PostgreSQL, managed with Drizzle ORM and validated by Zod, serves as the primary data store, leveraging Neon for serverless connections. Security measures include hashed tokens, JSONB audit logs, and AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data. The project is structured as a monorepo.

Key features include:
- **Tiered Translation Engine Customization:** A three-tier monetization system (Foundation, Growth, Enterprise) allowing for threshold tuning, control toggles, and custom compliance controls. It incorporates regulatory guardrails (e.g., HIPAA controls cannot be disabled), requires mandatory approval for custom controls, and maintains a complete audit trail.
- **AI Certification Workflow (Beacon):** A three-tiered certification system (Verified/Certified/Trusted) that automates testing for PHI exposure (using Presidio ML and regex fallbacks), clinical accuracy (with clinician review and evidence-based datasets), and bias detection (using Microsoft Fairlearn and variance-based fallbacks). It also validates deployment history.
- **Telemetry Polling Infrastructure:** Production-ready polling from various AI observability platforms via API, converting metrics to `aiTelemetryEvents` with PHI encryption. It includes database persistence for configurations, deduplication, and a management API, integrated with Inngest for scheduled and on-demand polling.
- **Epic EHR Integration Infrastructure:** A production-ready Epic FHIR adapter featuring credential encryption (AES-256-GCM), automated AI system discovery via the Device API, and scheduled/on-demand syncing via Inngest workflows. It includes a provider connection management API with ownership validation and credential redaction.
- **Legal Foundation:** Comprehensive, HIPAA-compliant templates for Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Business Associate Agreement (BAA), and Master Services Agreement (MSA), complete with subprocessor documentation.
- **Network Effects Infrastructure:** Dashboards ("NetworkEffectsView" and "NetworkReachView") for health systems and vendors to demonstrate market reach and procurement opportunities, including ROI tracking and a "Procurement Language Generator."
- **Advanced Security:** Features webhook signature verification, payload validation, secret management, rate limiting, fail-closed webhook security, and AES-256-GCM encryption with automated PHI redaction.
- **Compliance Expansion:** Support for ISO 42001 and a control versioning system.
- **Durable Workflows (Inngest):** Ensures zero data loss for critical processes through retries and cron scheduling.
- **Billing Infrastructure:** Schema for Stripe integration, plan tiers, and usage metering.
- **Enterprise SSO (WorkOS):** SAML/OAuth with auto-provisioning.
