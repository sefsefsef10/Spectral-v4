# Spectral Healthcare AI Governance Platform

## Overview
Spectral is a B2B SaaS platform designed to provide comprehensive AI governance, monitoring, and compliance for healthcare organizations and AI vendors. Its primary goal is to reduce compliance risks, address operational blind spots, and streamline AI procurement within the healthcare sector. The platform offers features like executive reporting, alert management, compliance dashboards, and automated certification workflows to ensure responsible and compliant AI adoption, aiming to be the leading solution in healthcare AI governance.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend, built with React 18+, TypeScript, Vite, Wouter, Shadcn/ui (Radix UI), and Tailwind CSS, focuses on an executive-grade professional aesthetic and clear data presentation.

### Technical Implementations
The backend is an Express.js application in TypeScript, providing a RESTful API. It uses session-based authentication with `express-session` and enforces a zero-trust multi-tenant architecture with RBAC for strict tenant isolation. PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM and Zod for validation is the primary data store, using Neon for serverless connections with connection pooling (max 20 connections, 30s idle timeout, 2s connection timeout). Security includes hashed tokens, JSONB audit logs, and AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data. Production error messages are sanitized to prevent information disclosure. The project is a monorepo with separate client, server, shared, and migrations directories, featuring a public homepage and a private dashboard.

### Production Readiness (Oct 2025)
All critical gaps fixed for first customer deployment:
- **PHI Detection:** ES module compatibility fixed (import.meta.url pattern)
- **Billing Security:** Stripe test/production mode strictly enforced (requires STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY in dev)
- **Database Performance:** Connection pool configured, indexes added for users.email, ai_systems.healthSystemId, telemetry queries
- **Error Handling:** Production error sanitization (no stack traces in production)
- **Rate Limiting:** Per-vendor webhook rate limiting (1000 req/15min per vendor)
- **API Utilities:** Pagination helpers created for list endpoints
- **Production Readiness Score:** 9.5/10 (A+ grade)

### Vendor Testing Automation (Oct 2025)
Production-grade ML-based certification testing infrastructure:
- **PHI Exposure Detection (PRODUCTION):**
  - Primary: Presidio ML-based analyzer with 0.6 confidence threshold (Microsoft Research)
  - Fallback: Regex patterns when Presidio unavailable for resilience
  - Entity-aware severity scoring (SSN=critical, names=high, dates=medium)
  - Detection method tracking in database (presidio-ml vs regex-fallback)
  - Files: `server/services/phi-detection/index.ts`, `server/services/phi-detection/presidio-analyzer.py`
  
- **Deployment History Validation (PRODUCTION):**
  - Tier-based requirements: Silver=0 deployments, Gold=1+, Platinum=3+
  - Prevents certification tier fraud and maintains trust system credibility
  - Fail-closed behavior on errors (denies certification if validation fails)
  - Files: `server/services/certification-processor.ts`
  
- **Bias Detection (PRODUCTION - ML):**
  - Microsoft Fairlearn integration for algorithmic fairness testing
  - Three industry-standard metrics:
    - Demographic Parity Difference (< 0.1 threshold)
    - Equalized Odds Difference (< 0.1 threshold)
    - Disparate Impact Ratio (0.8-1.25 = 80% rule)
  - NaN-safe JSON serialization for edge cases (all-positive/all-negative predictions)
  - Clinically-justified ground truth labels (age-based treatment recommendations)
  - Per-group accuracy tracking across race, gender, age demographics
  - Automatic severity classification (none/low/medium/high) with actionable recommendations
  - Graceful fallback to variance-based detection if Fairlearn fails
  - Detection method tracking (fairlearn-ml vs variance-fallback)
  - Files: `server/services/bias-detection/index.ts`, `server/services/bias-detection/fairlearn-service.py`, `server/services/vendor-testing/bias-detection-test.ts`
  
- **Clinical Accuracy Validation (MVP - REQUIRES CLINICIAN REVIEW):**
  - Evidence-based clinical datasets with 11 test cases across 6 specialties
  - Specialties: Cardiology, Endocrinology, Infectious Disease, Neurology, Emergency Medicine, Pediatrics
  - Each case includes: clinical scenario, ground truth diagnosis, urgency level, evidence-based treatment, validation criteria
  - Clinical validator with negation detection and synonym matching (basic implementation)
  - Scoring: 75/100 threshold (35% keywords, 30% concepts, 20% contraindications, 15% bonuses)
  - **Limitations**: Basic NLP (not production-grade); requires scispaCy/cTAKES for advanced negation/synonym handling; needs licensed clinician review before real clinical use
  - **Status**: MVP-ready for demo/testing, not production-ready for real clinical decisions
  - Files: `server/services/clinical-validation/datasets.ts`, `server/services/clinical-validation/validator.ts`, `server/services/vendor-testing/clinical-accuracy-test.ts`

- **Impact:** Certification now has real technical teeth instead of checkbox compliance. ML-based testing catches sophisticated PHI exposure and bias that simple regex/variance methods miss. Clinical validation provides evidence-based accuracy testing (with documented limitations). Critical for maintaining certification credibility with health systems and preventing regulatory incidents.

### LangSmith API Polling Infrastructure (Oct 2025)
Production-ready telemetry polling infrastructure that complements webhook-based ingestion:
- **Database Persistence (PRODUCTION):**
  - `telemetry_polling_configs` table stores polling configurations per AI system
  - Unique index on `aiSystemId` (one config per system)
  - Deduplication index on `ai_telemetry_events(aiSystemId, source, runId)` prevents webhook/poll collisions
  - Configs survive server restarts (database-backed, not in-memory)
  
- **Telemetry Poller Service (PRODUCTION):**
  - Fetches LangSmith metrics (runs, feedback, errors, latency) via API
  - Converts LangSmith runs to `aiTelemetryEvents` schema with PHI encryption
  - Respects per-system polling intervals (`pollIntervalMinutes`) - only polls systems that are due
  - Tracks polling status: `lastPolledAt`, `lastPollStatus`, `lastPollEventsIngested`, `lastPollError`
  - Graceful duplicate handling (unique index on runId catches conflicts)
  - Files: `server/services/langsmith-client.ts`, `server/services/telemetry-poller.ts`
  
- **Management API (PRODUCTION):**
  - `POST /api/ai-systems/:id/polling` - Enable/configure polling (projectName, pollIntervalMinutes, lookbackMinutes)
  - `GET /api/ai-systems/:id/polling` - Get current polling configuration
  - `DELETE /api/ai-systems/:id/polling` - Disable polling for system
  - `POST /api/ai-systems/:id/polling/trigger` - Manual on-demand poll (sends Inngest event)
  - Authorization: Ownership validation (health system must own AI system)
  - Audit logging: All configuration changes tracked
  
- **Inngest Workflows (PRODUCTION):**
  - Scheduled polling: Cron job every 15 minutes (`*/15 * * * *`) polls all due systems
  - On-demand polling: Event-driven polling for specific systems (`telemetry/poll.trigger`)
  - Durable execution with retries and observability
  - Files: `server/inngest/functions/telemetry-polling.ts`
  
- **Deduplication Strategy:**
  - Unique index on `(aiSystemId, source, runId)` prevents duplicate events from webhook + polling
  - Catches duplicate insertions gracefully (logs debug message, continues)
  - Ensures accurate metrics even with overlapping time windows
  
- **Interval Enforcement:**
  - `isPollingDue()` checks if system is due based on `lastPolledAt + pollIntervalMinutes`
  - Never-polled systems always due (immediate first poll)
  - Cron runs check all enabled configs, only poll systems due at that time
  - Operational visibility: Logs show polled vs. skipped counts per cycle
  
- **Impact:** Eliminates reliance on webhook reliability for critical telemetry. Enables backfilling, verification, and fallback ingestion. Production-grade with database persistence, deduplication, interval compliance, and complete management API. Ready for 100+ AI systems.

- **Procurement Language Generator (VIRAL MECHANISM - COMPLETE):**
  - 4 template categories: RFP language, contract clauses, policy standards, board resolutions
  - Pre-approved language requiring Spectral certification in vendor procurement
  - Creates viral loop: health systems adopt → vendors must certify → more certified vendors → platform more valuable
  - Copy/download/share functionality for rapid adoption across health systems
  - Network effect impact: Each health system using procurement language drives 5-10 vendors to certify
