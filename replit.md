## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
The frontend is built with React 18+ and TypeScript, utilizing Vite for tooling, Wouter for routing, Shadcn/ui (Radix UI) for components, and Tailwind CSS for styling. TanStack Query manages server state. The design emphasizes executive-grade professionalism and clear information delivery.

### Backend
The backend is an Express.js application written in TypeScript, exposing a RESTful API. It employs session-based authentication with `express-session` and enforces a zero-trust multi-tenant architecture with role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure strict tenant isolation.

### Data Storage
PostgreSQL serves as the primary data store, managed by Drizzle ORM for type-safe interactions and Zod for runtime validation. Neon serverless PostgreSQL driver is used for database connections. Security features include hashed tokens, JSONB audit logs, and AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive credentials.

### Application Structure
The project is organized as a monorepo, comprising distinct directories for the `/client` (React frontend), `/server` (Express backend), `/shared` (shared types and schemas), and `/migrations`. It features a public marketing homepage and a private dashboard with tailored views for health systems and AI vendors.
