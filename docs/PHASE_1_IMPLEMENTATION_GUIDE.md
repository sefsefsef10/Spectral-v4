## 🎯 Next Steps - Phase 2

### Week 3-4: Pilot Refactor (Certification Flow)

**Objective:** Prove Clean Architecture approach with one complete vertical slice

**Tasks:**
1. **Write Characterization Tests** (Week 3, Days 1-2)
   - Lock existing certification processing behavior
   - Test current scoring algorithm
   - Test validation logic
   - Test approval/rejection flows

2. **Extract Domain Entities** (Week 3, Days 3-5)
   - CertificationApplication entity
   - CertificationChecks value object
   - CertificationTier enum
   - Documentation value object
   - ComplianceStatements value object

3. **Create Use Case** (Week 4, Days 1-2)
   - ProcessCertificationApplicationUseCase
   - Request/Response DTOs
   - Gateway interfaces

4. **Implement Repository** (Week 4, Days 3-4)
   - CertificationApplicationRepository interface (domain)
   - DrizzleCertificationApplicationRepository (infrastructure)
   - Entity ↔ Database mapping

5. **Deploy with Feature Flag** (Week 4, Day 5)
   - Parallel implementation
   - Feature flag configuration
   - Gradual rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage for certification domain
- [ ] Zero regression bugs
- [ ] Feature flag working
- [ ] Team confident in approach
- [ ] Old code still functional

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
✅ Testing framework setup smooth and fast  
✅ Example templates provide clear guidance  
✅ Domain entity pattern well-documented  
✅ 100% test coverage achieved for examples  

### What Could Be Improved
⚠️ Need more team training on Clean Architecture principles  
⚠️ Should create more examples (UseCase, Repository)  
⚠️ Need to establish code review checklist  

### Actions for Phase 2
1. Schedule team workshop on Clean Architecture (1-2 hours)
2. Create UseCase and Repository templates
3. Set up code review checklist for architectural compliance
4. Establish pair programming for first refactoring
