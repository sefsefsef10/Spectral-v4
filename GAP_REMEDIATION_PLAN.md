## DEFERRED ITEMS (Post-MVP)

These gaps are not critical for initial production launch:

### Geographic Redundancy
- Multi-region database replication
- Active-active deployment
- Disaster recovery drills
**Reason**: Can scale horizontally first, add geo-redundancy at 100+ customers

### Bidirectional EHR Sync
- Write data back to Epic/Cerner
- Custom Epic App Orchard integration
**Reason**: Read-only telemetry is sufficient for monitoring use case

### OpenAI/Anthropic Direct Integrations
- Direct SDK integration vs webhooks
**Reason**: Current webhook approach works, can optimize later

### Load Testing at 10K+ events/sec
- k6/Locust performance testing
**Reason**: Current customer base won't hit this scale for 12+ months
