## VIII. Risk Mitigation & Due Diligence

### Identified Risks & Mitigations

**1. Integration Testing Limited**
- **Risk:** Limited real-world Epic sandbox testing
- **Mitigation:** Epic adapter operational, successful connection tests
- **Timeline:** Full sandbox testing achievable in 2-4 weeks

**2. Cerner/Oracle Integration Missing**
- **Risk:** Only Epic integration complete (not Cerner)

- **Mitigation:** Templates ready, standard industry agreements
- **Timeline:** Executable within 1-2 weeks

**4. Limited Customer Base (MVP Stage)**
- **Risk:** No paying customers yet (pre-revenue)
- **Mitigation:** Platform is acquisition target, not recurring revenue business
- **Timeline:** N/A - acquiring for technology and team, not customer base

### Regulatory Compliance Status
