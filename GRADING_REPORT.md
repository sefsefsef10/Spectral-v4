  // Step 1: Parse raw telemetry
  const parsed = await this.parseEvent(telemetryEvent);

  // Step 2: Map to compliance frameworks (CORE IP)
  const violations = await this.complianceMapper.mapToViolations(parsed);

  // Step 2.5: Check state-specific regulations
  const stateLawViolations = await stateLawEngine.checkCompliance(parsed, {...});

  // Step 3: Calculate risk score
  const riskScore = this.calculateRisk(parsed, violations);

  // Step 4: Generate required actions
  const actionsByViolation = this.actionGenerator.generate(violations);

  // Step 5: Determine escalation
  const { escalationRequired, escalationPath } = this.determineEscalation(violations, riskScore);

  return { originalEvent, violations, actions, riskScore, escalationRequired, escalationPath };
}
```

   - Comprehensive compliance coverage (HIPAA, NIST, FDA, state laws)
   - Real-time monitoring and alerting
   - Vendor certification workflow

---

### 🟡 **MODERATE GAPS (Addressable in 1-2 Months)**

1. **Vendor Testing Suite**
   - Need 20+ clinical validation datasets (currently 3-4)
   - Adversarial testing not integrated into vendor workflow
   - Sales enablement materials not auto-generated

2. **Enterprise Tier Features**
   - Customization approval UI incomplete (backend done, frontend partial)
   - No ML-based adaptive threshold learning

3. **EHR Coverage**
   - Only Epic adapter complete (Cerner, Athenahealth stubbed)
   - Acceptable for MVP but limits addressable market

4. **State Law Coverage**
   - 3 states (CA, CO, NYC) vs. 10+ states with emerging AI laws
   - Need: IL, MA, TX, VA, WA regulations

---

### 🔴 **CRITICAL GAPS (Must Address Before Production)**

1. **TESTING** ⚠️ **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
   - **Zero automated tests found**
   - No unit tests for Translation Engine (critical IP)
   - No integration tests for API endpoints
   - No E2E tests for compliance workflows
   - No security testing automation

   **Impact:** This is unacceptable for a healthcare compliance platform. A single bug in the Translation Engine could cause:
   - False negative (missed PHI breach) → lawsuit, regulatory fines
   - False positive (incorrect compliance violation) → health system loses trust
   - Data leakage (encryption failure) → HIPAA violation

   **Recommendation:** Immediate priority. Minimum viable testing:
   - Unit tests: Translation Engine, compliance mapping, state law engine
   - Integration tests: All API endpoints, especially `/api/alerts/*`, `/api/ai-systems/*`
   - E2E tests: Vendor certification workflow, compliance report generation
   - Security tests: Encryption, authentication, authorization

2. **Documentation**
   - No deployment guide (how to set up for a customer?)
   - No API documentation (how do vendors integrate?)
   - No architecture diagrams (how do new engineers onboard?)

   **Impact:** Limits scalability of engineering team and customer onboarding.

   **Recommendation:** High priority. Create:
   - OpenAPI/Swagger docs for all API endpoints
   - Deployment guide (Docker Compose, Kubernetes, cloud providers)
   - Architecture diagrams (Mermaid or PlantUML)
   - Service README files

## COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

### vs. Requirements ("Independent Verification Infrastructure")

| Requirement | Implementation | Grade |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **Independent** (not biased) | ✅ No vendor affiliation, separate from AI providers | A+ |
| **Healthcare-Specific** (not generic) | ✅ HIPAA, NIST AI RMF, FDA, state laws built-in | A+ |
| **Works With Anyone** (not locked-in) | ✅ Integrates Epic, LangSmith, Arize, custom vendors | A |
| **Two-Sided Network** (gets stronger) | ✅ Vendor acceptance tracking, network metrics | A |

**Assessment:** Spectral meets all 4 differentiators from the company description.

---

### vs. Competitors (From Requirements)

**Closed AI Platforms (Qualified Health, Microsoft Cloud):**
- ✅ Spectral is platform-agnostic (not a competitor)
- ✅ Complementary: Health systems use Qualified Health + Spectral

**Horizontal AI Monitoring (LangSmith, Arize, W&B):**
- ✅ Spectral integrates them (not a competitor)
- ✅ Translation layer adds healthcare-specific value

**Traditional GRC (OneTrust, ServiceNow):**
- ✅ Spectral specializes in AI-specific risks (different use case)

**Assessment:** Positioning is defensible and complementary to existing tools.
